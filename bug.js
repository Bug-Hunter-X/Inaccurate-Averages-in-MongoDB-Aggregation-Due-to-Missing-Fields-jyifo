```javascript
// Assuming you have a MongoDB collection named 'users'

db.users.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { age: { $gt: 25 } }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$city",
      averageAge: { $avg: "$age" }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort: { averageAge: -1 }
  }
]);
```
This aggregation pipeline has a potential issue. If the `city` field is sometimes missing, the `$group` stage will produce an unexpected result.  Specifically, documents without a `city` field are simply ignored.  This is a subtle error, as it doesn't cause a pipeline failure, but leads to inaccurate results. The average age will be calculated without considering users from cities without a specified `city` value.
